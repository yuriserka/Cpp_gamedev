  LIB to A converter v1.0
  Free Open Source program - GNU GPL Licence.


Overview

This tool automatically converts a .LIB file (MS Visual C linker library) 
into .A file (MinGW linker library).
It is useful to make a C/C++ program a reusable component.

I have written it because I did not have found a such tool over the Net.


Description

The main program is LIB2A.bat that performs successive stages for 
converting .LIB file to .A file into in the "convert" folder.


How it works

The conversion process is accomplished in several steps:
1) Copy your .LIB file and .DLL file into the "convert" folder.
2) Edit and replace the files names in the four first lines of the LIB2A.bat.
3) Run LIB2A.bat.

You can find your .A linker library into the "convert" folder.


License

The LIB to A program is under the GNU GPL license, that minds you may use it 
and distribute it freely, providing the copyright is unchanged.
See at the COPYING file for details. This doesn't mean GNU encourages you to 
convert your LIB file to A file. In fact, most of the tools here included may 
help C/C++ programmers.
